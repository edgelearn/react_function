# ReactJS Function Components

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start
```

1. Inside the my-app/src folder, create a new file named Component.js

2. Inside Component.js create a function that returns a string

3. Make the function be the default export.

4. Modify my-app/src to use Component.js instead of App.js in the import line.

5. View the page that was opened during the setup to see the results of your changes.

After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS Function Examples"
```
